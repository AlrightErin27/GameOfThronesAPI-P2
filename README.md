## The Only True Throne of Westeros 

### "Fools look at the Westerlands & see gold. Fools see our wealth & call it strength. Gold is just another rock. The Westerlands are strong because of House Lannister. From strong leadership comes unity; from unity comes power." ―Tywin Lannister

# Overview:

This website should read as an public website for Casterly Rock, run by the Lannister family. Users can personalize their info, enjoy access to Game of Thrones data, quizzes & perhaps even be able to build their own character. My styling, if stretch is reached, will be a municipal website blatantly run by House Lannister. Lots of propaganda, ads & the shabby look of real bureaucratic city websites.

# MVP:

⚔️ Let user's create a profile, & login/logout.

⚔️ Save user's content: username & additional info from site use.

⚔️ Make characters searchable, display info about them.

# Stretch Goals:

⚔️ Let other users comment on other users' posts.

⚔️ Create a few quizzes. Not all true or false.

⚔️ Let users create their own characters that are saved to their profile & the database.

⚔️ Extra CSS styling to make the website look more like a city's public website.

⚔️ Create a very simple quiz, that will be a few questions long, have multiple choice answers & will end with a loss or win.
