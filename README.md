# GameOfThronesAPI-P2

## Current name ideas: "Westeros' Public Library", "Vary's Little Birds" or "The Citadel's Library"

### An API of Ice And Fire: https://anapioficeandfire.com/

# Overview:

Overall, this website should read as an interactive and social media platform. Users can personalize their info, see other's profiles, as well as enjoy access to Game of Thrones data, quizzes and perhaps even be able to build their own character. My styling, if stretch is reached, will be a fun clash of medieval and high fantasy contrasting against the cartoonish bright colors of websites like Buzzfeed.

# MVP:

➡ Let user's create a profile, & login/logout.

➡ Save user's content: username, hashed password, email & additional info from site use.

➡ Make characters searchable, display info about them, and let users same them to their profile page.

➡ Let users post on their user page.

➡ Create a very simple buzzfeed style quiz, that will be a few questions long, have multiple choice answers that will determine 1 of 3 endpoints.

# Stretch Goals:

➡ Let other users comment on other users' posts.

➡ Create a few quizzes.

➡ Let users create quizzes.

➡ Let users create their own characters that are saved to their profile & the database.

➡ Extra CSS styling to make the website look more like Buzzfeed.
