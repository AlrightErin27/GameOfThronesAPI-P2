# Overview:

This website should read as an interactive & social media platform. Users can personalize their info, enjoy access to Game of Thrones data, quizzes & perhaps even be able to build their own character. My styling, if stretch is reached, will be a fun clash of medieval & high fantasy contrasting against the cartoonish bright colors of websites like Buzzfeed.

# MVP:

⚔️ Let user's create a profile, & login/logout.

⚔️ Save user's content: username, hashed password, email & additional info from site use.

⚔️ Make characters searchable, display info about them.

⚔️ Create a very simple buzzfeed style quiz, that will be a few questions long, have multiple choice answers & will end with a loss or win.

# Stretch Goals:

⚔️ Let other users comment on other users' posts.

⚔️ Create a few quizzes. Not all true or false.

⚔️ Let users create their own characters that are saved to their profile & the database.

⚔️ Extra CSS styling to make the website look more like Buzzfeed.
