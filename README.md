### "Fools look at the Westerlands & see gold. Fools see our wealth & call it strength. Gold is just another rock. The Westerlands are strong because of House Lannister. From strong leadership comes unity; from unity comes power." ―Tywin Lannister

# ⚔️ ⚔️ 👑 ⚔️ ⚔️

# Overview:

This website should read as an public website for Casterly Rock, run by the Lannister family. Users can personalize their info, enjoy access to Game of Thrones data, quizzes & perhaps even be able to build their own character. My styling, if stretch is reached, will be a municipal website blatantly run by House Lannister. Lots of propaganda, ads & the shabby look of real bureaucratic city websites.

# MVP:

⚔️ Let user's create a profile, & login/logout.

⚔️ Save user's content: username, hashed password & additional info from site use.

⚔️ Make characters searchable, display info about them.

⚔️ Create a very simple quiz, that will be a few questions long, have multiple choice answers & will end with a loss or win.

# Stretch Goals:

⚔️ Let other users comment on other users' posts.

⚔️ Create a few quizzes. Not all true or false.

⚔️ Let users create their own characters that are saved to their profile & the database.

⚔️ Extra CSS styling to make the website look more like a city's public website.

# Sprints:

🐉 03/03/21: Logon, create account & logout all working. Cookies are working. Today I plan to make the API searchable, add table associations, let the user select favorites & hash the passwords.

🐉 03/03/21: Make favorite characters viewable on user's home page. Make sure code is dry. Hit MVP. Decide what stretch goal I will begin working towards.

# User Story:

1. The first page you see, as a user, is the login page.
2. At this page you choose to either...

   A. create a user account, enter in a username & password.

   B. login to an already existing account.

3. The next page the logged in user will see is their home page.
4. The user from their home page can add some text to their "about me" area.
5. Once logged in, the user will always have the navigation bar at the top of the page.
6. The user can use the navigation bar to do 3 things from their home page.

   A. Log out-- this brings you back to an empty login page.

   B. Database-- the user can search the API.

   C. Quizzes-- users can take quizzes and see the result at the bottom of the quiz page.

# Notes:

👑 In order to meet requirements for this assignment, I may shift focus & change my MVP & stretch. Getting the user's & letting them search the api will be the first things I do. From there it is likely that I let users save their favorite characters to their profile & build a quiz.👑
👑 Currently, to hit MVP I need to make the API search able, give tables associations, and build saved favorites to user's page. May change theme. Instead of Buzzfeed, basing the styling & story on bureaucratic website's for states or cities. Maybe make fake campaign ads, public services, library card renewal at Citadel library...etc 👑
